    before rising to prominence as a teen idol on the television series 21 Jump Street (1987–1990). <br> In the 1990s, Depp acted
    mostly in independent films with auteur directors, often playing eccentric characters. <br> These included Cry-Baby (1990),
    What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), Benny and Joon (1993), Dead Man (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997), and Fear and Loathing
    in Las Vegas (1998). <br> Depp also began his longtime collaboration with director Tim Burton, portraying the leads in the
    films Edward Scissorhands (1990), Ed Wood (1994), and Sleepy Hollow (1999).</p>

    <h2>Early life</h2>

    <p>John Christopher Depp II was born on June 9, 1963, in Owensboro, Kentucky, the youngest of four children of
    waitress Betty Sue Depp (née Wells; later Palmer) <br> and civil engineer John Christopher Depp. Depp's family
    moved frequently during his childhood, eventually settling in Miramar, Florida, in 1970. <br> His parents divorced in
    1978 when he was 15, and his mother later married Robert Palmer, whom Depp has called "an inspiration". <br>
    
    <br> Depp's mother gave him a guitar when he was 12, and he began playing in various bands. He dropped out of Miramar
    High School at 16 in 1979 to become a rock musician. <br> He attempted to go back to school two weeks later, but the
    principal told him to follow his dream of being a musician. In 1980, Depp began playing in a band called The Kids.
    <br> After modest local success in Florida, the band moved to Los Angeles in pursuit of a record deal, changing its name to
    Six Gun Method. <br> In addition to the band, Depp worked a variety of odd jobs, such as in telemarketing. In December 1983,
    Depp married makeup artist Lori Anne Allison, the sister of his band's bassist and singer. <br> The Kids split up before
    signing a record deal in 1984, and Depp began collaborating with the band Rock City Angels. <br> He co-wrote their song
    "Mary", which appeared on their debut Geffen Records album Young Man's Blues. Depp and Allison divorced in 1985.</p>
